# Country and State Sorter in Java

This Java program demonstrates how to model countries and their corresponding states using object-oriented programming (OOP). The data is sorted in ascending alphabetical order by country name and by state name within each country.

## ðŸ§¾ Features

- Uses classes `Country` and `State` to represent real-world entities.
- Implements `Comparable` interface to enable alphabetical sorting.
- Displays country details including capital and population.
- Displays each state's population and area in square kilometers.

## ðŸ§± Classes

### `State`
Represents a state/province with:
- `name` (String)
- `population` (long)
- `area` (double in sq.km)
Implements `Comparable<State>` to allow alphabetical sorting.

### `Country`
Represents a country with:
- `name` (String)
- `population` (long)
- `capital` (String)
- `states` (List of `State`)
Implements `Comparable<Country>` to allow alphabetical sorting of countries.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. States are created and grouped under their respective countries.
2. Countries and their states are sorted alphabetically.
3. The data is displayed in a formatted manner.
